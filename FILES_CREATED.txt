FILE STATISTICS:
================
Total files created: 6
Total documentation lines: ~1,800
Total reading time: ~60 minutes
Total planning time spent: Complete

KEY DOCUMENTS:
==============

For Quick Understanding:
  → Start with INDEX.md (2 min)
  → Then PLANNING_SUMMARY.md (10 min)

For Full Project Understanding:
  → ROADMAP.md (phase breakdown)
  → agents.md (tech stack)

For Starting Phase 1:
  → DEVELOPMENT.md (setup guide)
  → PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md (task list)

ANSWERS PROVIDED:
=================

1. Do we refactor or create fresh?
   → Create fresh locally, merge when ready
   → Git branch strategy with svelte-refactor

2. Best practice approach?
   → Yes, this combines Git branching + modular docs
   → Industry standard for teams

3. Is this professional?
   → Yes, markdown docs + git strategy
   → Avoids overkill (no JIRA/GitHub Projects)
   → Right balance for team of 1 + AI

4. Framework choice (Svelte vs React vs Vanilla)?
   → Svelte is best for your context
   → Simplicity + power + small bundle
   → Reactive stores built-in

5. Cost & Timeline?
   → $2/month (negligible)
   → 6-7 weeks (with buffer: 8-9 weeks)
   → Low financial risk

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Read INDEX.md (navigation guide)
2. Read PLANNING_SUMMARY.md (understand decisions)
3. Get OpenAI API key (openai.com/account/api-keys)
4. Set $5 monthly budget limit
5. When ready: Follow DEVELOPMENT.md for Phase 1

STRUCTURE:
==========

All documentation follows a consistent format:
- Clear headers and sections
- Tables for quick reference
- Code examples where relevant
- Checklists for progress tracking
- Links between related documents
- Professional tone suitable for teams

This documentation will:
✓ Guide you through Phase 1-7
✓ Help AI agents understand the project
✓ Prevent scope creep (clear phase boundaries)
✓ Enable safe deployment (git strategy)
✓ Track progress (checklists)
✓ Provide rollback capability (git history)

READY TO START?
===============

Yes. Everything is planned and documented.

Next: Follow DEVELOPMENT.md to set up Phase 1 locally.
