# Phase 1: Edit Drawer - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Built

A complete edit drawer feature that allows users to edit prompts before copying or sharing them.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Edit Button** ✏️
- Added pencil icon button next to each prompt
- Positioned between the prompt text and existing Copy/Back-to-top buttons
- Matches existing design language

### 2. **Full-Screen Edit Drawer**
- Slides up from bottom with smooth animation
- Full device height for comfortable editing
- Dark overlay behind drawer (tappable to close)
- Matches app aesthetic (#eeeeee background)

### 3. **Drawer Header**
- Sticky header in #555555 (same as main app header)
- Becomes translucent (rgba(85, 85, 85, 0.7)) when content is scrolled
- **Left side buttons:**
  - **Share** button with share icon
  - **Copy** button with copy icon
- **Right side:**
  - **Close (X)** button

### 4. **Editing Area**
- Large, responsive textarea
- Pre-populated with selected prompt text (HTML stripped to plain text)
- Purple focus border (#4f0388) matching brand colors
- Mobile-optimized font sizes
- Cursor automatically positioned at end of text

### 5. **Smart Functionality**

#### Copy Button
- Copies edited text to clipboard
- Visual feedback: button turns purple with pulse animation
- Resets after 2 seconds

#### Share Button
- **Mobile:** Uses Web Share API - opens native share sheet
- **Desktop:** Falls back to copying to clipboard
- Graceful error handling

#### Close Button
- Closes drawer and clears content
- Also closeable by:
  - Tapping overlay
  - Pressing ESC key

### 6. **Mobile Optimizations**
- Auto-focus on textarea with 350ms delay (iOS compatibility)
- Keyboard launches automatically on mobile devices
- Prevents body scroll when drawer is open
- Responsive button sizes and spacing
- Touch-optimized tap targets

## Files Modified

1. **index.html** - Added drawer HTML structure
2. **style.css** - Added complete drawer styling with animations
3. **script.js** - Added all drawer logic and event handlers

## How to Test
